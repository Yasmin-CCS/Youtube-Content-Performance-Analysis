### 🔴 Problem

⚠️ Without a clear understanding of engagement drivers, creators risk:

- Posting content that underperforms in views, likes, and comments
- Misjudging the impact of thumbnails and titles
- Missing opportunities to align content with audience sentiment

### 🟢 What I Did

🧪 Collected and analyzed data from **four similar YouTube channels**:

- 📊 Measured **general engagement metrics** (views, likes, comments)
- 🧠 Applied **Hugging Face models** for semantic analysis of audience sentiment
- 🖼️ Examined **thumbnails and titles** to test their predictive power
- 🤖 Trained multiple models to predict video views based on these features
    
    ✅ **Random Forest Regression** performed best among the tested models

### 🟢 Outcome

📊 Results are still limited, suggesting the need to expand the dataset with **more videos across more channels**

🏆 Identified Random Forest as the most promising model for view prediction

📈 Provided early insights that can guide creators in refining their content strategy
